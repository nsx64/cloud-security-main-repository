### Pentesting and Security Projects  

This is where I keep my technical projects related to cloud security architectures, pentesting guides, and proof-of-concepts (PoCs). It also serves as a personal resource repo for learning key security concepts, especially for certifications and skill development.

#### What to Expect:  
- Cloud security architectures  
- Cloud security PoCs  
- Pentesting guides and related PoCs  
- And more
